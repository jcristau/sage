    A class consisting of constructors for several common transducers.

    A list of all transducers in this database is available via tab
    completion. Type "``transducers.``" and then hit tab to see which
    transducers are available.

    The transducers currently in this class include:

    - :meth:`~Identity`
    - :meth:`~CountSubblockOccurrences`

    def Identity(self, input_alphabet):
        """
        Returns the identity transducer realizing the identity map.

        INPUT:

        - ``input_alphabet`` -- the input alphabet.

        OUTPUT:

        A transducer mapping each word over ``input_alphabet`` to
        itself.

    def CountSubblockOccurrences(self, block, input_alphabet):
        """
        Returns a transducer counting the number of (possibly
        overlapping) occurrences of a block in the input.

        INPUT:

        - ``block`` -- a list (or other iterable) of letters.
        - ``input_alphabet`` -- input alphabet.

        OUTPUT:

        A transducer counting (in unary) the number of occurrences of the given
        block in the input.  Overlapping occurrences are counted several
        times.

        Denoting the block by `b_0\ldots b_{k-1}`, the input word by
        `i_0\ldots i_L` and the output word by `o_0\ldots o_L`, we
        have `o_j = 1` if and only if `i_{j-k+1}\ldots i_{j} = b_0\ldots
        b_{k-1}`. Otherwise, `o_j = 0`.
